## Illusions of Reality: A study of photographic manipulation across history

In my thesis work I'm focusing on postproduction in photography. It's history and current state in the digital age. The natural development and technological advancements that helped to boost it's development. I also want to touch the subjects of postproduction in photojournalism and how postproduction was used or is still used to decieve and manipulate. It's not an easy topic that's for sure.

#### Postproduction

Photographic manipulation was always something photographers chased after. From photographing fabricated situations, to adding something that wasn't there in the first place. Even one of the inventors of photography staged one of his photographs as a reaction for him not to be mentioned as the inventor. His name was Hippolyte Bayard and he photographed himself as a drowned man. He was then rightfully mentioned as one of the inventors. We can say he was the first man to ever manipulate a photograph, by staging it to be precise.

From then on photographers found ways to manipulate a photograph with the invention of film. One of the popular phenomenons was to put faces of the deceased loved ones on family portraits. This was obviously a photographic manipulation, but it helped photographers to lure in more people to get their portraits done. Everyone believed that this was true and that their loved ones are still with them even after death. Some can say this was one of the first attemts to fool the public eye with a noble and undestanding nature. But the selfish undertone of those photographers to make more money with photography seems detrimental.
