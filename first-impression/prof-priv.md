  Ultravagant is a very young fashion brand that aims to shine a new light to clothing sustainability and upcycling. Their main emphasis is to "Be yourself", to ushackle yourself from societal norms and trends and wear whatever you want to wear. Ultravagant wants to bring some new spice in czech clothing industry in high-end fashion, as well as normal day to day clothing. But clothing isn't the only thing they do. Their studio is also a "Culture spot", where they stage events such as slam poetry, various art expositions (Photography, sculptures, paintings, ...), music concerts and fashion shows. So not only they contribute to diversification of clothing industry, they also support cultural or art movements and educates themselves and those around them.

  I've had the opportunity to work for Ultravagant two years ago. First as an intern helping everyone in marketing team but as the time went I became the head of video production. Long YouTube videos and sometimes the short-form videos that were published on social media. And in my free time I still helped to document events and photograph clothing sewn by UltraVagant to be put on the online shop.
