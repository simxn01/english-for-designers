# A Pinch - Distasteful culinary term

- [First Draft](fist-draft.md)

## Rough draft

As a student, I’ve come to realise very early that if I’m going to live alone I should be able to to cook myself variety of meals depending on my mood and taste. So I started to learn various recipes, my favourite meals, healthy meals, junk food even. But across all the recipes and meals I prepared I was always irritated about one word. Pinch.

The source of this irritation comes from my nitpicking and attention to details. I’m always precise when I’m making a meal for myself, my significant other, a family member or my friends. I always weigh my ingredients and the reason being is I like consistency. Making consistently good meals fills me with joy when I’m cooking, because I don’t have to worry if I added too much or too little, It’s never really my fault when I don’t like the food I cooked. If I don’t like the food, that means I should find a different recipe. But the unmeasurable unsolvable vague culinary term for measuring salt will always haunt me.

Salt in meals push it to perfection especially if it’s made with less ingredients so It’s really important to salt your meals, but how do I know If it’s enough? Everyone’s fingers are different size, there are different kinds of salt varying in size of the crystals and saltiness, different meals require different amounts. One chef will add a very generous amount of salt and then the other just a little squeeze, but both will say “just a pinch.” Each chef interpretation varies so it makes a really unreliable and frustrating measurement.

Another fact that surprises me is that the term “pinch” is so casually accepted in the culinary world. Esteemed chefs and and amateur cooks alike seem to gloss over this unreliable unit of inaccuracy with ease. How have generations and generations of cooks not came up with more reliable more precise substitute?

Some would say that a good chef must always taste their meals to ensure the salt levels are perfect. If not, add more. Simple, right? But for a home cook that’s trying variety of recipes of familiar or unfamiliar food, the vagueness of this word just creates confusion and uncertainty when cooking a new recipe.

In conclusion, while the word continues to spread confusion amongst the amateur home cooks, my stand for this term will always stay still. I can only imagine so many meals ruined by “just one pinch of salt.” So until there’s a universally agreed-upon measure for this word, it will always be my Achilles heel in my cooking expertise.
