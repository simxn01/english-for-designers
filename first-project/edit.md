## A pinch - Distasteful culinary term

As a student, I realized early on that living alone meant I needed to cook for myself. So, I began exploring various recipes – from my favorite dishes to healthy options and even junk food. But in almost every recipe, one word irritated me: "pinch."

My frustration stems from my attention to detail. I measure everything when I cook, aiming for consistency. If a dish turns out well, I want to recreate that success. If it doesn’t, I blame the recipe, not my measurements. But the term “pinch,” always throws me off.

Salt is crucial. It can perfect a dish, especially simpler ones. But what exactly is a "pinch"? People's fingers vary in size, and salts differ in grain size and saltiness. One chef might use a generous ammount of salt, another only a little squeeze, but both might call it a "pinch." This inconsistency makes the term very frustrating.

What surprises me is the culinary world's acceptance of "pinch." Both expert chefs and beginners use it without question. Why haven't we found a clearer alternative after generations and generations of chefs?

Some argue that chefs should adjust salt by taste. That might work for professionals, but for someone like me, trying new recipes, "a pinch" is confusing.

In conclusion, the term "pinch" adds uncertainty for many home cooks like me. I can only imagine so many meals ruined by “just one pinch of salt.” So until there’s a universally agreed-upon measure for this word, it will always be my Achilles heel in my cooking expertise.
