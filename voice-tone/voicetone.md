# Voice, Tone and Style

### Voice

Voice isn't my strongest part. Although I talk very calm and collected, people around me tend to overhear what I said, because my voice isn't pervasive. Even with my slowly worsening hearing condition I can hear myself loud and clear, but other around me cannot say the same. So when I speak publicly or in front of an audience, I try to speak up more, but that does not feel natural for  me and that takes away my actual voice. 

As I said my voice is pretty calm and collected. I rarely get frustrated or angered and even more rarely express it with my voice. (I think I might have forgot how to shout.) Some of the other traits my voice has are open-mindness, empathy, playfulness with a sense of excitement and modesty.

I've always loved to have a discussion with other people. We are social animals after all. And that reqires for you to have an open mind. Not everyone you're going to meet is going to share similar ideas that you have, so having an open mind really helps to have a conversation with people you don't agree with. And thats when modesty and empathy comes in. I personally don't believe some opinions are better than others, even mine. And opinions change as the seasons come. And you can't be the expert on everything so being modest when you express yourself is really important to me. And empathy really helps to learn from opinions you don't agree with and gives you value from conversations with other people. 

### Tone

Tone of my writing is something I can't really decipher myself. But from what I observed from others talking about my tone I can say I'm playful storyteller. Telling stories was something I wasn't really good at when I was younger, but as the time went on and I got older, I've developed my own way of telling stories.

When I talk about a story I'd like to be whole. Mention all relevant circumstances and details so my punchline is well put and has greater value. I don't really like to be straight forward when I'm telling stories, I find it really boring. But it of course depends on the circumstances. And being playful when telling a story really helps to make the story more amusing and fun, which I think is very valuable. Being a good storyteller helps me in my creative endevours and also amuses the people around me, which I find great joy in that.

### Style

The style of my writing varies. Highly depends on the formality of the text. I still struggle with formal texts, because of my not so rich professional background, but I'm learning my ways as I go. In informal texts I tend to write long sentences when I express my emotions. It's probably because emotions are really intriguing. Emotions have so many forms and not one emotion is the same for everyone, so when I write, I'd like to specify it more. But then when I'm not talking about something with an emotional undertone, my sentences get shorter.

I also feel that sometimes I run out of words to use, so I try to write my texts with rich vocabular arsenal. Not only It makes me look smarter but makes the text a little more nicer to read. I hate to repeat the same words again and again, so I've learned how to change things up a bit.
