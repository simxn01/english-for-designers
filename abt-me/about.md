### Who am I?

I'm a visual creative person. Doesn't really matter what I do, I just need to create things. From drawing, animating, designing, sewing to my favourite activity, photographing. 

I started taking pictures when i was 13 years old with my moms digital camera that dad gave her for her birthday. I used to borrow it all the time and then went out to the wild to capture some action. Almost ten years later I still have her camera and chances are that when you bump into me, I have it around my neck or in my backpack. But my moms camera wasn't THE reason I got really into photography. 

It was when my dad gave me his old analogue camera for my 16th birthday. The thrill and worry I have when I take a picture on my analogue camera fills me with joy. I really enjoy the aspect of not seeing immediately your pictures after you took them. And then when you develop them, It's like I was a little kid again and my mum gave me Kinder surprise.
